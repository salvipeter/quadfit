io.{hh,cc}
----------
  Procedures for output.
  - sampled mesh [STL]
  - control net [OBJ]
  - sampled boundary curves [OBJ]

bspline-fit.{hh,cc}
-------------------
  B-spline surface fitter.
  - on n x n sample points
  - fixing any control point of the original
  - simple smoothing

multiply.{hh,cc}
----------------
  Procedure multiplying two B-spline bases, creating a d-by-linear B-spline surface,
  interpolating a point- and a derivative function.
  - based on:
    X. Che, G. Farin, Zh. Gao, D. Hansford: "The product of two B-spline functions".
    Advanced Materials Research, Vol. 186, pp. 445-448, 2011.
  - uses numerical integration (Newton-Cotes of [at most] degree 12)
  - but it is exact (when the resulting degree is <= 6)

connect-g1.{hh,cc} + connect-test.cc
------------------------------------
  G1 connection of two opposing cubic-by-linear B-spline ribbons using a direction blend.
  - the result is a sextic-by-linear surface
  - symmetric (not master/slave; the cross directions are computed by taking the mean)

fit-ribbon.{hh,cc} + ribbon-test.cc
-----------------------------------
  Given a cubic-by-linear B-spline ribbon, and a list of parameters and corresponding h values,
  modifies the ribbon s.t. its cross-derivative is multiplied by h at these positions.
  - the result is a sextic-by-linear surface
  - the scaling function is cubic, fitted on the h values with zero-tangents on both ends

quadfit.{hh,cc} + quadfit-test.cc
---------------------------------
  The main library routine. Reads a PWGB file and fits surfaces approximating the samples,
  while also maintaining G1 continutiy between the patches, and interpolating the outer ribbons.
