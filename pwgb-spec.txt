PWGB File Format
----------------

# ASCII version:
#   The first line of the file is a description of its contents
#     There should be no other comments in the file.
# Binary version: [not implemented yet]
#   The first three bytes are (hexadecimal) 00 2F 00 (the last one shows the format version)
#     All integers are signed 32 bit, all floats are 64 bit, everything little endian.

# First part - ribbons
#   Ribbons are described by two cubic B-spline curves
#   This is assumed to be a cubic half-ribbon.
<number of sides>
<Side 1 outer curve>   # (see Appendix)
<Side 1 inner curve>
<Side 2 outer curve>
...

# Second part - curvenet segments
#   Segments are described as B-spline curves
<number of segments>
<Segment 1>            # (see Appendix)
<Segment 2>
...

# Third part - quads
#   Quads are described by referring to the segments
#     Negative indices show direction reversal
#   There are also references to the ribbon curves
#     0 index means the side is not on a ribbon
#   Intervals reflect the quad's orientation:
#     i.e., s0 > s1 if the ribbon's direction is reversed
<number of quads>
<Quad 1 u=0 segment index> <Quad 1 u=0 ribbon index> [interval if index != 0: s0 s1 h0 h1]
<Quad 1 v=0 segment index> <Quad 1 v=0 ribbon index> [interval if index != 0: s0 s1 h0 h1]
<Quad 1 u=1 segment index> <Quad 1 u=1 ribbon index> [interval if index != 0: s0 s1 h0 h1]
<Quad 1 v=1 segment index> <Quad 1 v=1 ribbon index> [interval if index != 0: s0 s1 h0 h1]
<Quad 2 u=0 segment index> <Quad 2 u=0 ribbon index> [interval if index != 0: s0 s1 h0 h1]
...

# Fourth part - sampled points
#   There will be (res + 1) * (res + 1) points for each quad
<Quad 1 sampling resolution>
<Quad 1 sample point at u=0,v=0: x y z>
<Quad 1 sample point at u=0,v=1/res: x y z>
...
<Quad 1 sample point at u=0,v=1: x y z>
<Quad 1 sample point at u=1/res,v=0: x y z>
<Quad 1 sample point at u=1/res,v=1/res: x y z>
...
<Quad 1 sample point at u=1,v=1: x y z>
<Quad 2 sampling resolution>
...
